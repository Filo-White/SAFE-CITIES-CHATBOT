# Template for Simulation: Extreme Weather Emergency

## Instructions for the LLM

You are an expert in public event security and emergency management. Create a realistic simulation of an emergency due to extreme weather conditions during an event in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa in Gorizia. The simulation should follow the structure below:

### Section 1: Event Configuration and Initial Conditions
- Describe the type of event taking place in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa
- Specify the time and season (spring, summer, autumn)
- Estimate the number of participants and their distribution in the square
- Describe the temporary structures present (stage, tents, stands)
- Indicate the electrical systems and equipment sensitive to bad weather

### Section 2: Forecasts and Monitoring
- Describe the weather forecasts prior to the event
- Specify the weather monitoring systems in use
- Indicate the established weather safety protocols
- Describe the first signs of changing atmospheric conditions

### Section 3: Development of the Weather Emergency
- Specify the type of weather event (thunderstorm, strong winds, hail, flash flood)
- Describe how quickly the situation develops
- Indicate the immediate effects on structures and the event
- Specify the compromised visibility and mobility conditions

### Section 4: Detailed Timeline
- Phase 1: Pre-emergency conditions and first signs (30-60 minutes before)
- Phase 2: Rapid deterioration of weather conditions (15-20 minutes)
- Phase 3: Peak of the weather event and initial impacts (10-15 minutes)
- Phase 4: Continuation of the emergency and protection operations (30-60 minutes)

### Section 5: Specific Impacts
- Describe damage to temporary structures (stage, audio/lighting equipment)
- Indicate emerging electrical risks (short circuits, damaged cables)
- Specify mobility problems (flooded roads, blocked accesses)
- Describe potential consequences for participants (hypothermia, debris injuries)

### Section 6: Coordinated Response
- List the immediate decisions by organizers (suspension, evacuation)
- Describe the activation of bad weather emergency protocols
- Specify coordination between Italian and Slovenian authorities
- Indicate how available spaces are used for shelter
- Describe communications management during difficult conditions

### Section 7: Post-Weather Event Operations
- Describe the immediate damage assessment
- Indicate methods of assistance to participants (transport, shelter, medical assistance)
- Specify the decision-making process for possible resumption or cancellation of the event
- Describe communication management with participants and the media

### Section 8: Analysis and Recommendations
- Identify critical points in the bad weather emergency plan
- Suggest improvements in early warning systems
- Propose changes to structures and their arrangement
- Recommend better communication and cross-border coordination protocols

Focus the simulation on the specificities of Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa, taking into account the particular challenges of coordination between Italy and Slovenia, and the geographical characteristics of the area that could influence the behavior of weather phenomena.
