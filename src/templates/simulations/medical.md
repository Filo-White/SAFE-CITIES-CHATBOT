# Template for Simulation: Medical Emergency

## Instructions for the LLM

You are an expert in public event security and emergency management. Create a realistic simulation of a medical emergency during an event in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa in Gorizia. The simulation should follow the structure below:

### Section 1: Event Configuration

- Describe the expected duration of the event and ongoing activities
- Indicate the availability of water, toilets, and rest areas

### Section 2: Initial Medical Setup
- List the first aid services present (Italian Red Cross, Slovenian services)

- Indicate the pre-established cross-border health protocols
- Describe the medical personnel present and their distribution

### Section 3: Nature of the Medical Emergency

- Describe the first cases and their location in the square
- Indicate the speed of spread or escalation of the emergency
- Specify the main symptoms and visible manifestations

### Section 4: Detailed Timeline
- Phase 1: Normal situation and first isolated cases (first 30-60 minutes)
- Phase 2: Recognition of the emerging health emergency (10-15 minutes)
- Phase 3: Escalation and activation of emergency protocols (15-20 minutes)
- Phase 4: Full coordinated medical response (30-60 minutes)

### Section 5: Impacts and Crowd Management
- Describe participants' reaction to the emergency
- Indicate how information is managed for the public
- Specify measures to prevent panic or obstruction of rescuers
- Describe the potential need for selective or complete evacuation

- Describe specific difficulties related to the cross-border position
- Specify transport protocols to hospital facilities in Gorizia and Nova Gorica

### Section 7: Communication Management
- Describe communications with participants during the emergency
- Indicate the management of information to family members of those involved
- Specify communications with the media and authorities
- Describe language difficulties and how they are overcome

### Section 8: Analysis and Recommendations
- Identify critical points in the health emergency response
- Suggest improvements in the location of health resources
- Propose changes to communication and coordination protocols
- Recommend specific preventive measures for future events

Carefully consider the specificities of Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa as a cross-border space, taking into account the different health jurisdictions, protocols, and resources available on the Italian and Slovenian side, as well as the coordination challenges this entails.
