# Template for Simulation: Terrorist Attack

## Instructions for the LLM

You are an expert in public event security and emergency management. Create a realistic simulation of a terrorist attack during an event in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa in Gorizia. The simulation should follow the structure below:

### Section 1: Event Overview
- Describe the type of event taking place (official ceremony, concert, public celebration)
- Specify the time (day or night) and weather conditions
- Estimate the approximate number of participants (specify if it's an event with regulated or free access)
- Briefly describe how the square is organized (stage, screens, VIP area, etc.)
- Indicate the presence of authorities or VIPs, if relevant

### Section 2: Security Measures in Place
- List the Italian and Slovenian security forces present (Polizia di Stato, Carabinieri, Guardia di Finanza, Policija, Specialna Enota)
- Describe the access control points (how many and where, screening with metal detectors)
- Identify active surveillance systems (CCTV, patrols)
- Specify the presence of medical teams and emergency units

### Section 3: Nature of the Attack
- Describe the specific type of terrorist attack (explosive, drone, vehicle, firearms)
- Indicate the exact point and moment of the attack
- Specify how the attacker or device infiltrated
- Describe how the attack bypasses initial security measures

### Section 4: Detailed Timeline
- Phase 1: Pre-attack conditions (first 20-30 minutes of the event)
- Phase 2: Threat identification (first detection, 5-10 minutes)
- Phase 3: Moment of attack and immediate chaos (5-10 minutes)
- Phase 4: Security forces response and evacuation (15-30 minutes)

### Section 5: Impacts and Consequences
- Estimate potential casualties and injuries
- Describe crowd panic and chaotic movements
- Indicate psychological, diplomatic, and media impact
- Identify damage to infrastructure, if relevant

### Section 6: Coordinated Response
- Describe collaboration between Italian and Slovenian forces
- Specify emergency protocols activated
- List VIP and public evacuation procedures
- Describe coordination of cross-border medical services

### Section 7: Lessons and Recommendations
- Identify vulnerabilities exploited in the attack
- Suggest improvements to security measures
- Propose improved cross-border protocols
- Recommend more effective screening procedures

Use the specific geographic information of Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa, consider its border position between Italy and Slovenia, and keep in mind the constraints of cross-border coordination for emergency services.
