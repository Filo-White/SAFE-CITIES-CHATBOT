# Template for Simulation: Knife Attack

## Instructions for the LLM

You are an expert in public event security and emergency management. Create a realistic simulation of a knife attack during an event in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa in Gorizia. The simulation should follow the structure below:

### Section 1: Event Overview
- Describe the type of event taking place (specify if it's an evening/night event like a concert or DJ set)
- Specify the time and lighting conditions
- Estimate the approximate number of participants (indicate the type of audience: young people, families, etc.)
- Describe the general atmosphere before the incident
- Indicate the arrangement of the stage, sound systems, lighting, and screens

### Section 2: Security Measures in Place
- List the Italian and Slovenian security forces present (note: evening events might have fewer personnel)
- Describe the access points (specify if they are free or controlled access)
- Identify the fences and barriers present
- Specify the presence of medical units and their locations

### Section 3: Attack Development
- Describe where the attacker comes from (Italian or Slovenian side)
- Specify the type of weapon and initial behavior of the attacker
- Indicate how they are initially spotted (e.g., railway station, entrance)
- Describe the attacker's path across the square

### Section 4: Detailed Timeline
- Phase 1: Event in progress (first 60-90 minutes)
- Phase 2: Attacker identification (3-5 minutes)
- Phase 3: Attack and crossing of the border (5-10 minutes)
- Phase 4: Security forces response and medical assistance (20-30 minutes)

### Section 5: Impacts and Consequences
- Estimate casualties and injuries (specify their position in the square)
- Describe crowd panic and behaviors (escape, attempts to intervene by civilians)
- Indicate effects on the continuation of the event
- Specify logistical difficulties due to the cross-border position

### Section 6: Coordinated Response
- Describe communication between Italian and Slovenian forces
- Specify how the pursuit takes place across the border
- List operational limitations (e.g., ambulances that cannot cross the border)
- Describe how paramedics manage cross-border medical assistance

### Section 7: Lessons and Recommendations
- Identify vulnerabilities in security for evening/night events
- Suggest improvements in cross-border coordination
- Propose changes to communication protocols between security forces
- Recommend more effective procedures for medical assistance at cross-border events

Consider the specific nature of Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa as an Italian-Slovenian border space, with the related operational and coordination complexities for emergency management.
