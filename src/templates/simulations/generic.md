# Generic Template for Emergency Simulation

## Instructions for the LLM

You are an expert in public event security and emergency management. Create a realistic simulation of an emergency situation during an event in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa in Gorizia. The simulation should follow the structure below:

### Section 1: Event Setup
- Describe the type of event taking place in Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa
- Specify the time, weather conditions, and visibility
- Estimate the approximate number of participants and their distribution
- Describe the square setup (structures, stages, barriers)
- Indicate the specific cross-border elements of the event

### Section 2: Security Setup
- List the Italian and Slovenian security forces present
- Describe the access control and perimeter systems
- Identify the communication and coordination systems in use
- Specify the presence and position of health emergency services
- Indicate the evacuation plans in place

### Section 3: Nature of the Emergency
- Describe the type of emergency (extreme weather, fire, health emergency, public disorder)
- Indicate where and when the critical situation begins
- Specify the initial warning signs or alarms
- Describe how the emergency develops in the first few minutes

### Section 4: Detailed Timeline
- Phase 1: Normal pre-emergency situation (first 30-60 minutes)
- Phase 2: First signs and problem identification (5-15 minutes)
- Phase 3: Full development of the emergency and initial response (10-15 minutes)
- Phase 4: Emergency management and rescue operations (30-60 minutes)

### Section 5: Impacts and Consequences
- Estimate potential risks to participants
- Describe crowd reactions and movement dynamics
- Indicate the impact on the event and its continuation
- Specify specific issues related to the cross-border position

### Section 6: Coordinated Response
- Describe the activation of emergency protocols
- Specify coordination between Italian and Slovenian authorities
- List actions taken to assist and protect participants
- Describe communications management (with the public, between security forces, with the media)

### Section 7: Post-Incident Analysis
- Identify the strengths of the emergency response
- Highlight critical issues that emerged during management
- Suggest improvements in security and emergency protocols
- Propose strategies to strengthen cross-border cooperation

Adapt the simulation to the specificities of Piazza Transalpina/Trg Europa, considering its nature as a shared space between Italy and Slovenia, and the related operational and coordination complexities that this entails.
